## Map showing Toronto's Heat Relief Network 

### Context 
The urban heat island effect occurs in dense urban environments which are filled with paved surfaces and closely packed buildings, resulting in heat being trapped more efficiently. In cities like Toronto, providing spaces for the population to cool down, such as airconditioned spaces or shaded vegetation areas, is vital as prolonged exposure to excessive heat can have negative effects on one's health

### Content 
Map showing point features which have been classified to reflect what type of facility they represent.  
The map displaces a pop-up when a point feature is clicked, showing the location name where the facility can be accessed. 
THe navigation bar includes links to Toronto's heat Relief Strategy and Climate Atlas of Canada's Urban Heat Island information page.
